## Instructions:
For Lab 4, there is a choice of two labs. Both labs will use passenger data from the Titanic. This is a common data set
used in Kaggle competitions. Please choose one of the following labs, or do both if you have the time. The description of each lab and a pointer to the instructions are documented below. 

1. Watson Machine Learning lab  
2. Watson Studio SPSS Modeler Lab


## Watson Machine Learning Lab (4a)

## Introduction:

In this lab, you will use IBM's Watson Machine Learning GUI to train, evaluate, and deploy a Watson Machine Learning model based on the Titanic dataset.  

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the Watson Machine Learning GUI.  
2. Train/Evaluate a machine learning model
3. Deploy a machine learning model. 
4. Deploy an application that invokes the machine learning model service.

## Watson Studio SPSS Modeler Lab (4b)

## Introduction: 

In this lab, you will use the Watson Studio SPSS Modeler capability to explore, prepare, and model passenger data from the Titanic. The SPSS Modeler is a drag and drop capability to build machine learning pipelines. 

## Objectives: 

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the Watson Studio SPSS Modeler capability
2. Profile the Titanic data set 
3. Explore the Titanic data set with visualizations
4. Cleanse and Transform the data 
5. Train/Evaluate a machine learning mode.
